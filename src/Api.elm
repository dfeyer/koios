port module Api exposing (Cred, application, logout, storeCredWith, username, viewerChanges)

{-| The authentication credentials for the Viewer (that is, the currently logged-in user.)
This includes:

  - The cred's Username
  - The cred's authentication token
    By design, there is no way to access the token directly as a String.
    It can be encoded for persistence, and it can be added to a header
    to a HttpBuilder for a request, but that's it.
    This token should never be rendered to the end user, and with this API, it
    can't be!

{-| It's important that this is never exposed!
We epxose `login` and `application` instead, so we can be certain that if anyone
ever has access to a `Cred` value, it came from either the login API endpoint
or was passed in via flags.
